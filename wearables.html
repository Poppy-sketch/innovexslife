            <h2>Battery Life and Power Management</h2>
            <p>Battery life varies dramatically across wearable categories. Basic fitness trackers achieve 5-14 days per charge through e-ink displays and selective sensor usage. Full-featured smartwatches with always-on displays typically last 1-2 days, though some models extend to 3-5 days through larger batteries or efficient processors. Specialized GPS watches can run 20-40 hours in tracking mode or weeks in smartwatch mode.</p>
            
            <p>Power management technologies optimize battery longevity. LTPO displays dynamically adjust refresh rates from 1Hz when static to 60-120Hz during interaction. Processors transition between high-performance and ultra-efficient cores based on workload. GPS multi-band usage switches between satellite systems to balance accuracy and power consumption. Solar charging panels in some premium models supplement battery life during outdoor activities.</p>

            <h2>Health and Fitness Tracking</h2>
            <p>Modern wearables function as comprehensive health monitoring systems. Heart rate monitoring occurs continuously, detecting resting heart rate trends, maximum heart rate during exercise, and heart rate variability indicating stress and recovery. Advanced devices detect irregular rhythms potentially indicating atrial fibrillation, prompting medical consultation. Blood oxygen monitoring helps assess respiratory health and sleep quality, particularly important at high altitudes or for individuals with breathing conditions.</p>
            
            <p>Sleep tracking analyzes sleep stages including light, deep, and REM sleep, providing insights into sleep quality and patterns. Temperature sensors detect variations potentially indicating illness onset or menstrual cycle changes. Stress monitoring uses heart rate variability and other biometric data to identify stress levels and suggest breathing exercises. Fall detection and emergency SOS features potentially save lives by automatically contacting emergency services when serious falls are detected.</p>

            <h2>Privacy and Data Security</h2>
            <p>Wearables collect intimate health and behavioral data, raising privacy concerns. Understanding what data devices collect, where it's stored, who has access, and how it's used is crucial. Most manufacturers store data in cloud services for analysis and syncing across devices. Some provide options for local storage and processing, though this typically reduces available features.</p>
            
            <p>Health data receives special regulatory protection in many jurisdictions. Ensure manufacturers comply with relevant regulations like HIPAA in the US or GDPR in Europe. Review privacy policies carefully, particularly regarding data sharing with third parties, advertisers, or insurance companies. Use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and regularly review connected apps and their permissions.</p>

            <h2>The Future of Wearables</h2>
            <p>Emerging technologies will dramatically expand wearable capabilities. Non-invasive blood glucose monitoring could transform diabetes management. Blood pressure monitoring through optical sensors may eliminate cuffs. Hydration and electrolyte level tracking could optimize athletic performance and health. More sophisticated AI will provide proactive health alerts and personalized coaching based on long-term data analysis.</p>
            
            <p>Form factors will diversify beyond wrists and ears. Smart rings offer discrete health monitoring in jewelry form. Smart clothing with embedded sensors provides detailed biomechanical analysis. Skin patches enable continuous medical-grade monitoring. Brain-computer interfaces, though still experimental, promise direct neural interaction with technology. As sensors shrink, power efficiency improves, and AI advances, wearables will become increasingly capable, discrete, and integrated into daily life.</p>
